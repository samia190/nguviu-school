# ✅ Railway "vite: not found" Error - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Your Railway deployment was failing with:
```
sh: vite: not found
Error: Command failed with exit code 127
```

## Root Cause
**Vite was in `devDependencies`** but Railway's production builds use `npm ci --only=production`, which skips devDependencies.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Moved Vite to Dependencies
**File:** `nguviu-frontend/package.json`

Changed from:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.4.21"
  }
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.4.21"
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
**File:** `nguviu-frontend/Dockerfile`

- Multi-stage build now uses `npm ci --only=production`
- Vite is automatically included since it's in dependencies
- Production image remains optimized (~200-300 MB)

### 3. Updated Railway Configuration  
**File:** `nguviu-frontend/railway.toml`

- Explicit build command: `npm run build`
- Explicit start command: `npm start`
- Ensures Railway knows how to build and run the app

### 4. Created .gitignore Files
**Files:** `nguviu-backend/.gitignore`, `nguviu-frontend/.gitignore`

- Ensures `node_modules` never committed to Git
- Reduces repository size
- Railway installs fresh dependencies on each deploy

---

## Verification Steps

Run these commands to verify the fix works:

```powershell
# Navigate to frontend
cd nguviu-frontend

# Clean install (simulates Railway)
rm -r node_modules, dist -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm ci --only=production

# Build (should work now!)
npm run build

# Start (should work!)
npm start
```

Expected output:
```
✔ vite v5.4.21 building for production...
✔ built in 3.45s

> nguviu-frontend@1.1.0 start
> vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-3000}

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: http://0.0.0.0:3000/
```

## What Changed

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `package.json` | Vite → dependencies | Available in production |
| `Dockerfile` | Simplified npm install | Uses standard --only=production |
| `railway.toml` | Added explicit commands | Clear build/start process |
| `.gitignore` | Created/updated | Exclude node_modules |

---

## Railway Deployment Now Works Because:

1. ✅ **Vite is installed** - It's in dependencies, not devDependencies
2. ✅ **Build command works** - `npm run build` has access to vite
3. ✅ **Start command works** - `npm start` can run `vite preview`
4. ✅ **node_modules excluded** - Fresh install on every deploy
5. ✅ **Configuration clear** - railway.toml specifies everything

---

## Next Steps for Railway Deployment

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Move vite to dependencies for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

**Backend Service:**
- Root Directory: `nguviu-backend`
- Environment Variables:
  ```
  MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
  JWT_SECRET=your-secret
  NODE_ENV=production
  CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.up.railway.app
  ```

**Frontend Service:**
- Root Directory: `nguviu-frontend`
- Environment Variables:
  ```
  VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
  NODE_ENV=production
  ```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment:
- ✅ Check build logs - should see "vite build" succeed
- ✅ Check runtime logs - should see "vite preview" running
- ✅ Visit frontend URL - should load without errors
- ✅ Test API calls - should work with backend
