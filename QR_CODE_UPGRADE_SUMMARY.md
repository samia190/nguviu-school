# QR Code System Upgrade - Enhanced Student Verification

## Overview
The student verification QR code system has been upgraded to include additional information for more comprehensive student verification.

## What's New

### Enhanced QR Code Data
The QR codes now include the following information:

1. ✅ **Assessment Number** (for CBE students)
2. ✅ **Class and Stream**
3. ✅ **School Website Link** (https://kangaru girls.ac.ke)
4. ✅ **Student Photo URL** (if available)
5. ✅ **Admission Number** (existing)
6. ✅ **Full Student Details** (existing)

### Security Features Maintained
- 🔒 Cryptographically signed tokens
- ⏰ 2-minute expiry window
- 🔐 HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- 🚫 Prevents forgery and replay attacks
- 🔄 Version control to invalidate old cards

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Student Model ([Student.js](kangaru girls-backend/models/Student.js))
- Added `websiteUrl` field (default: "https://kangaru girls.ac.ke")
- Updated `generateVerificationToken()` to include:
  - Assessment number
  - Class and stream
  - Photo URL
  - Website URL
- Updated `verifyToken()` to validate all new fields

#### 2. Verification Routes ([studentVerification.js](kangaru girls-backend/routes/studentVerification.js))
- Updated `/generate-token/:studentId` endpoint to return enhanced student data
- Updated `/verify` endpoint to return:
  - Assessment number
  - Website URL
  - All existing fields

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. Verification Display ([StudentVerification.jsx](kangaru girls-frontend/src/components/StudentVerification.jsx))
- Added display for **Assessment Number** (when available)
- Added clickable **School Website Link**
- Enhanced layout to accommodate new information

#### 4. ID Card Component ([StudentIDCard.jsx](kangaru girls-frontend/src/components/StudentIDCard.jsx))
- Updated to use secure verification tokens
- QR codes now link to verification page with encrypted data
- Added error handling for QR generation failures

## How It Works

### 1. QR Code Generation
When an admin generates a QR code:

```javascript
// Backend creates a token with enhanced data
const token = student.generateVerificationToken();
// Token includes: admission number, assessment number, class, 
// stream, photo URL, website URL, and security data

// Frontend creates verification URL
const verificationUrl = `${baseUrl}/#/verify-student?t=${token}`;
// QR code encodes this URL
```

### 2. QR Code Scanning
When someone scans the QR code:

1. Scanner opens verification URL
2. Frontend extracts token from URL
3. Token sent to backend for validation
4. Backend verifies:
   - Signature is valid
   - Token not expired (< 2 minutes old)
   - Student record matches
   - Card is active
5. Returns full student information including:
   - Name, photo, admission number
   - **Assessment number** (CBE)
   - **Class and stream**
   - **School website link**
   - Card validity dates

### 3. Verification Display
The verification page now shows:

```
✅ VERIFIED STUDENT

📸 Student Photo (if available)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Benefits

### 1. Enhanced Student Identification
- Assessment numbers help identify CBE students
- Class information shows current academic level
- Photo verification (when available)

### 2. Better Information Access
- Website link provides quick access to school information
- Verifiers can easily contact school if needed
- All key student data in one scan

### 3. Maintained Security
- All new fields are cryptographically signed
- Cannot be tampered with or forged
- Same 2-minute expiry prevents reuse

### 4. Backward Compatible
- Old QR codes still work (until card reissued)
- New fields are optional (assessment number, photo)
- Graceful degradation if data missing

## Testing

### Test with CBE Student
1. Create student with assessment number
2. Generate QR code
3. Scan and verify assessment number appears

### Test with Non-CBE Student
1. Create student without assessment number
2. Generate QR code
3. Verify page shows other data correctly

### Test Photo Display
1. Add photo URL to student
2. Generate QR code
3. Verify photo appears on verification page

### Test Website Link
1. Scan any student QR
2. Click website link on verification page
3. Verify opens school website

## Migration Notes

### Existing Students
- All existing students will use default website URL
- Assessment numbers can be added via student edit
- Photos can be added anytime
- Regenerate QR codes to include new data

### Database Changes
- New field: `websiteUrl` (String, default provided)
- Existing fields used: `assessmentNumber`, `photoUrl`
- No breaking changes to schema

## Security Considerations

### What's Protected
✅ All QR data is cryptographically signed  
✅ Tampering detected immediately  
✅ 2-minute expiry prevents screenshot reuse  
✅ Version control invalidates old cards  
✅ Token includes timestamp and nonce  

### What to Know
⚠️ QR codes expire after 2 minutes - generate fresh when needed  
⚠️ Website URL is public info - safe to display  
⚠️ Photo URLs should use secure HTTPS  
⚠️ Assessment numbers are student identifiers - handle appropriately  

## Support
