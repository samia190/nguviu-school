# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Enhanced Results System

## What's New?

Three major enhancements to the student results system:

1. **📄 PDF Upload** - Admins can upload pre-generated PDF result slips
2. **📚 Results History** - Students see latest result first, can view all past results
3. **📊 Performance Monitoring** - Automatic analysis with holiday study recommendations

### Option 1: Upload PDF Result
1. Click **"📄 Upload PDF Result"** button (pink)
2. Select student from dropdown
3. Enter term, year, curriculum, grade
4. Choose PDF file (max 10MB)

### Option 2: Manual Entry (Traditional)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Failed to upload PDF"
**Solution:** 
- Check file is actually a PDF
- Check file size < 10MB
- Verify student exists in system
- Check `public/results/` directory is writable

### Problem: "No performance insights shown"
**Solution:**
- Insights only appear if student has previous results
- First term = no comparison possible
- Check previous result exists in database
- Verify `performanceChange` field populated

### Problem: "PDF link doesn't work"
**Solution:**
- Check VITE_API_URL in frontend .env
- Verify backend serving static files from `public/`
- Check PDF actually exists in `public/results/`
- Try accessing directly: `http://localhost:5000/results/filename.pdf`

### Problem: "Assessment number verification fails"
**Solution:**
- Assessment number required ONLY for CBE students
- Leave blank for 8-4-4 students
- Check student has assessment number in database
- Verify case-sensitive match
